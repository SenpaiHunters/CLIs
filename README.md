# CLIs
---
CLI stands for Command-Line Interface. It is a text-based user interface that allows users to interact with a computer by entering commands into a terminal or command prompt. The CLI provides a way to perform various tasks, such as executing programs, managing files and folders, configuring settings, and more, through a command-line interpreter.

To use a CLI, you open a terminal or command prompt on your computer and type specific commands followed by optional arguments. Each command performs a specific action or task. The CLI often provides a set of built-in commands, but you can also install and use additional command-line tools and utilities.

Using a CLI can be advantageous for tasks that require automation, scripting, or remote access. It allows you to execute commands quickly, perform complex operations with ease, and integrate with other software and systems. By learning the commands and their syntax, you can effectively navigate and manage your computer or server via the command line.
